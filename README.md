Current e-commerce solutions are continuously researching and investing to provide the best deals for their customers. However, the amount of time a user spends to buy an online product and service is big. The process of searching across e-commerce stores to find the best deals itself can be daunting.
Also once a user buys a product /service, it's not necessary that the user got the best deal. There may be other sellers providing better deals on the same product in other e-commerce stores.
So the problem to solve is:
How can a customer get the best deal of a product/service she wants to buy?
Instead of being an active buyer, how can a customer be a passive buyer?
Our platform shopper-zoid can be described as a platform where people can get their desired product without doing extensive research.
